# UNITS OF MEASURE:
#   Overall Units: Select either Inch-Pound or Metric (IP/METRIC).
#               This will determine whether the temperatures in Tables 1-4
#               are read as degree F or C. Enter "IP" or "METRIC" below
#               in LM1 line. Do not change the position
#
#   Pipe Diameter: Select either Inches or Millimeters (INCH/MM).
#               This will not affect the insulation thickness data
#               Enter "INCH" or "MM" below in LM1 line. 
#               Do not change the position

#
# ***********************************************************************
#  For both valves and fittings: 
#
#      LENGTH = A + B*Pipe_Diameter^C
#
#  LENGTH is the length of pipe which would need to be insulated to equal
#  the insulation required for one valve/fitting.
