#
#   Purpose: 
#   
#   An example for a system library for "fitting frequency" rules.
#   THE SECOND PART OF THIS FILE CONTAINS THE NEW PIPE DIAMETER TABLE AND DISCUSSED SUBSEQUENTLY, IN CAPS. 
#   These rules are currently used by the PIPE - Process piping component in Plant Bulks Piping
#   Field numbers are shown below the table heading. Note comments can not include vertical bars.
#
#   The user should name this file with a .DAT extension and place it in the PID's directory.
#   The base name should not be longer than 8 characters (IE FILENAME.DAT) FILENAME cannot be more than
#   8 characters. The name of the file to use is specified for a project in the
#     Project Specs - Design Basis - General Piping Specs(G PIPE) 
#
#   Explanation of (#)Fields:
#
# 5 specifications allowed in the field one for each Pipe Type.(IE 5 Lines)
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   (1)Routing Type:  Piping classification "Routing Type" that the user specifies on the component
#                     to indicate which set of defaults from this file should be used on the component.
#                     The system allows 5 sets of specifications, one set assigned to each of the
#                     following list of 3 letter codes. (The note is simply a comment on general use):
#                       AGU  - Above Ground Unit
#                       AGR  - Above Ground Rack
#                       UGU  - Underground Unit

#
# The user need not specify all eight types, but must specify at least one in order to generate fittings.
#........................................................................................................
#
#
# Rules and comments:
#
# 1)   Fitting Distribution percentages must add up to 100% for fittings and 100% for valves
#
# 2)   The units used as the basis for a fitting spec file(This file)  must match the units of  
#      any project where it is used. IE the length of pipe and the max dia specs. No error will be given.
#
# 3)   The fitting/valve count can be boosted by adding more fittings at the component level. 
#
# 4)   If user specifies flanges in the fitting frequency/distribution then the system will not generate
#      extra flanges for the valves specified in the valve frequency/distribution. If no flanges are specified
#      in fitting freqency/distribution then system will generate flanges for valves as needed.
#
# 5)   The user can generate multiple fitting spec files and provide the file name at the project
#      level and thus can account for variations between projects and differences in units, etc.
#      The use of the same fitting specification file in two projects defined with differing
#      units (IP/Metric) should be avoided.
#
# 6)   If the user names the file FITSPC.DAT and places it in the PID's directory it will be used
#      by all projects with no other filename specified in the Piping Specs.
#

#
# Example:
#
# For a PIPE component with only the following specifications(all others are default):
#
#      1000 FT Length specified.
#      4 IN Dia specified.
#      OTH pipe type specified.
#      N(o) Horizontal allowance is specified.
#
# The following calculations are done based on the data section below.
#     
# From below for OTP Pipe Type 
#
#           Vert Allow = 130
#
# Actual piping length = User input length * Vert Allow/100
#
#                      = 1000 FT * 130/100 = 1300 FT
#
# From below for OTP Pipe Type
#
#        Max Small Dia = 1.5IN
#       Max Medium Dia = 6.0IN
#
# 4IN Diameter is Medium Dia
#
# From below for OTP Pipe Type and Medium Dia
#
#         Fitting Freq = 30
#           Valve Freq = 20
#
#        Fitting count = Actual piping length * Fitting Freq / 100FT
#
#                      = 1300 FT * 30 / 100 FT = 390 Fittings
#
#          Valve count = Actual piping length * Valve Freq / 100FT
#
#                      = 1300 FT * 20 / 100 FT = 260 Valves      
#
#  From below for OTP Pipe Type
#
#          Fittings    Distribution               Valves       Distribution
#         ---------    ------------             __________     ____________

#
#           # of EL = Fitting count * Distr / 100
#
#                   = 390 Fittings * 40 / 100 = 156 EL's
#
#           # of TE = Fitting count * Distr / 100
#
#                   = 390 Fittings * 20 / 100 = 78 TE's
#
#           likewise 78 additional FL's and 78 RE's
#                  Note that the final number of flanges is actually 78 as calculated above.
#                  The system will not calculate extra flanges for the valves below when flanges have been specified
#                  in the fittings frequency/distribution.
#
#           # of BA = Valve count * Distr / 100
#
#                   = 260 Valves * 20 / 100 = 52 BA's
#
#           likewise 52 BU's , 104 GA's and 52 CH's.
#
#  Fittings calculated will be rounded off, and hence the totals may not add up correctly in all cases.

#THE SECOND PART OF THE FITTING SPECIFICATION FILE CONTAINS THE PIPE DIAMETER TABLE AS DISCUSSED BELOW
#   Explanation of (#)Fields:
#
# Field one Must be specified as PIPE DIA 
# Subsequently, there are 27 Pairs of fields; each pair is composed of pipe diameter and an identifier; the pipe diameters must
#               be the standard, ICRAUS I-P or Metric pipe diameters; every pipe diameter in the ICARUS standard must be used.
#               There are two possible identifiers, namely, 'S', and 'N'.
#               S	Means standard pipe diameter;
#               N       Means Non-standard pipe diameter, i.e., ICARUS will not produce this pipe diameter unless specifically asked for;
