#
#   Purpose: 
#
#   A flexible system for making indirect and pro-ratable(direct cost) additions to a project.
#   Additions can be fixed or based on direct costs for all or per contractor. Costs generated can be
#   assigned to any code of account and allocated as material cost, labor cost, man-hours or indirects.
#
#.......................................................................................................
#
#   Adding File to a project:
#
#   The items specified in this file will be added to the project when this file is name INDIRECTS.DAT
#   and is located in the same directory as the input specification file(specs).
#
#   Using this File as a library:
#
#   For IC2000:
#       The administrator places this file in the Admin directory with the name LIBRARY.IND
#       (LIBRARY can be anything the user wants).  The file INDIRECTS.SET(You can start with 
#       INDIRECTS.SET.proto for example), is edited and a line with the LIBRARY.IND is added.
#
#       To use it, open any project with no INDIRECT.DAT file, you will be prompted to select a
#       file when accessing the Project Indirects/Pro-ratables menu.
#
#   For Kbase-Framework products:
#       The administrator places this file in the Data\Indirects directory with name LIBRARY.DAT
#       (LIBRARY can be anything the user wants).
#
#       To use it, open any project and go to the Project Basis - Custom External - Indirects
#       and right click - select to chose the desired library
#

#
#   Explanation of (#)Fields:
#
#   (1)Key Field(K):              The Key Field.  Currently All Indirect/Pro-ratables use IP.
#                                 A # in column 1 indicates a comment.
#
#   (2)Contractor Basis(CT):      Used to determine the basis for percentage items.  Only costs
#                                 assigned to this contractor will be considered in calculated
#                                 the adder.  Note an entry of '**' indicates all contractors
#                                 but is only allowed on direct accounts
#
#   (3)Account(Acct):             The adder will be assigned to this account.  This account will
#                                 be used to determine which contractor this cost will be assigned to.
#                                 This value should be based on the project account codes.
#                                 (User codes when in use)
#
#   (4)Item Description:          Used in reports to identify the item.

#   Comments:
#
#   1) Multiple costs can not be generated on each item.  Percentage costs will be ignored
#      if fixed costs are specified. Unit costs are the exception to this and can be specified
#      with other costs.
#
#   2) Labor Hours booked to indirect accounts also require a wage rate to be specified.
#
#   3) Wage rate is not allowed on items booked to direct accounts.
#
#   3) Direct costs are reported at the end of each area.
#
#   4) Indirect costs are calculated for each contractor during indirects calculation.
#
#   5) Material and labor are not reported separately for indirects.
#
#   6) Pro-ratable percentages assigned to direct accounts are all calculated based on values
#      before applying any pro-ratables. Indirect and Pro-ratable percentages assigned
#      to indirect accounts are all calculated based on values including direct pro-ratables.
#
